title: About Me
---


My research is interdisciplinary and lies at the intersection of anthropology, sociology, gender and women’s studies, and the study of health and human behaviors in broadly sociocultural and environmental contexts. 

My overarching research explores the dynamic relationship between cultural constructions and daily behavior. More specifically, I have two interrelated research foci, each centered on a different environment: 
*(a) the sociocultural environment, in which meanings and ramifications of skin color (e.g., as related to race, class, social inequality, body image, and gender) have implications for identity, daily behavior, and health outcomes; and 
*(b) the college environment, in which students’ time use has implications for their development and college experience.
